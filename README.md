### What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them

1. In HTML, multiple elements can be returned while Nested JSX must return one element, which we’ll call a parent element that wraps all other levels of nested elements:
2. HTML elements have attributes while JSX elements have props.
3. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element while You can’t use the word class to define HTML classes, since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, instead, use — className. 

### Why can’t browsers read JSX?
Because JSX is not valid JavaScript, browsers can't read it directly; they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React.
